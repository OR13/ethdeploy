## ethdeploy v0.1.0 -- the first publish

Excited to launch the first ethdeploy module. This module is meant to be a highly configurable deployment staging tool. Contract deployment can be a very complicated process, which certainly requires it's own modules to preform the task. Javascript is a relatively good choice to build such a staging module -- considering its accessibility as a language. This module is meant to make the arduous task of staging and deploying your contracts relatively menial. The main ethdeploy module is meant to hold the core code of the deployment staging processes. However, other modules for cli and webpack integrations will come.
